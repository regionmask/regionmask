************************************
create masks of geographical regions
************************************

Determine which geographic region each grid point belongs to.

When working with gridded data such as climate model output or reanalysis data it is
often important to create regional averages, e.g., over countries, continents or
regions defined in the literature. To do so we need to know for each grid point to which
region it belongs to.

regionmask is a python package that:

- can be used to create *masks* of geographic *regions* for arbitrary longitude and latitude grids.
  These masks indicate which region a gridpoint belongs to. They come in two variants:

  - :doc:`2D integer masks<notebooks/mask_2D>`
  - :doc:`3D boolean masks<notebooks/mask_3D>`

- takes great care to consistently treat gridpoints and overlapping regions, see

  - :doc:`Edge behavior and interiors<notebooks/method>`
  - :doc:`Overlapping regions<notebooks/overlap>`

- contains a number of defined regions, including:

  - :doc:`countries</defined_countries>`
  - :doc:`landmasks</defined_landmask>`
  - :doc:`regions used in the scientific literature</defined_scientific>`

- can :doc:`plot figures of these regions<notebooks/plotting>`

- supports using arbitrary existing or user-defined region definitions:

  - regions defined as shapefiles can be :doc:`accessed via geopandas<notebooks/geopandas>`
  - :doc:`user-defined regions<notebooks/create_own_regions>` can be created via numpy or shapely
